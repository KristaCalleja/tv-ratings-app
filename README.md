The challenge is to create a TV ratings app which:
- Lets me search a TV show title;
- Shows me the rating of each episode;
- Shows me the the general trends per season (is it getting better or worse).

I have the amount of episodes each season has
I have an array to iterate how many times I should run that 

I know how many seasons there are (y)
Every season has x number of episodes

I need to parse the url x number of times and when it finishes it needs to parse y times
